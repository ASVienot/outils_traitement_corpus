# Dataset Card for Dataset Name
This dataset loisFr aims to be a base template for new datasets arround the French legislative system. 
This dataset card has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/datasetcard_template.md?plain=1).

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->
This dataset is 

- **Curated by:** Alix Sirven-Viénot
- **Funded by :** PluriTal
- **Shared by [optional]:** [More Information Needed]
- **Language(s) (NLP):** French
- **License:** [More Information Needed]

### Dataset Sources [optional]
- **Repository:**: https://github.com/ASVienot/outils_traitement_corpus

## Uses
This dataset was created to be use as a training corpus for models to recognise and categorise French laws.  

### Direct Use
This dataset can be used to train models to do different NLP tasks. The first is to recognize the types of law it is or from wich code it is from. 

### Out-of-Scope Use
This dataset would not work well for models other than legal or legislative related corpus and models.

## Dataset Structure
This dataset contains 9 fields: 
- num : path from the book to the law (ex: code > Partie (législative/réglementaire/decret/annexes) > Livre nbr > Titre nbr > Chapitre nbr > article nbr ) 
- title : number of the article followed byt the book/code it belongs to (ex: L5511-2-1 du Code de la santé publique)
- id : official ID of the article - format: LEGIART+diggit (ex: LEGIARTI000006796412)
- date: date it was put into effect - format: YYYY-MM-DD (ex: 2020-02-12) 
- body : the text of the law 
- modTitle : the name given to the last modification of the article (ex: decret number that changed it)
- code : name of the code it belongs to  
- type : the type of the article depending on it's origin : https://reflex.sne.fr/codes-officiels  
  - L : issu d'une loi (le pouvoir législatif)
  - R : issu d'un décret (les réglementations)  
  - D : issu d'un décret
  - A : issu d'un arrêté ou une annexe 
  - autres: somes codes do not have prefixes added to the number of their article (ex: le code civil) 
- nbr_mot: the number of words in each article

## Dataset Creation
### Curation Rationale
In the long run, this dataset was created to be a first step into creating a model to help students in law school presort and link justice decision to the law they were based on. 

### Source Data
The source of this dataset was the website https://codes.droit.org/ who gathers all the 78 codes of the French law in each 3 differents formats (pdf, rss, xml). 

#### Data Collection and Processing
<!-- This section describes the data collection and processing process such as data selection criteria, filtering and normalization methods, tools and libraries used, etc. -->
The data was collected using a scraping sript to collect all the codes and put each article with their informations in a csv file. 
It was then annotated with another script to add the remaining columns. 
Librairies used :  

### Annotations [optional]
The raw dataset went through an annotation script to add the columns of type and number of words. 

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations
<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

### Recommendation
<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->
Users should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the dataset. More information needed for further recommendations.


## Glossary [optional]
<!-- If relevant, include terms and calculations in this section that can help readers understand the dataset or dataset card. -->
L : legislative article 
R : reglementaire article 
A : annexes 
D : decret
autre : other
